# Angular Workshop

## Instructions
This is the final version of the Angular workshop that was held in Rich Web Experience 2014. All the solutions are in the `solutions` branch.

To get these changes

- Make sure that you have no uncommitted changes in your version. If so you can either
    - Undo all the changes via a `git reset --hard`
    - If you prefer to keep your changes just make a commit via `git add .` followed by `git commit -m "My changed"`
- Do a `git fetch` followed by a `git checkout solutions`

If you know your way around Git then you can `git-checkout` individual commits to see the changes in each. If you are not then go to the [commits](https://github.com/looselytyped/angudone-workshop/tree/solutions) page and click on the "Browse Code" link next to each change to see what changed
